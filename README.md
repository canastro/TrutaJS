Stupid ES6 Framework
======
This is not a production ready framework... This is just my playground for ES6 features.

Usage
------
I'll create a small application using this TrutaJS


ES6 features used
------
* Shadow DOM
* Web components
* Quasi-literal
* Object.observe (is this ES7?)
* Map and Sets
* Arrow functions
* Classes
* Promise
* Object.assign
